# AnimeJS Demo
This project is built using [anime.js](https://animejs.com/ "anime.js") a javascript tool used to make animations easier.

The code is very simple, I just wanted to check out some of the features in anime.js by randomly generating animations.

## Demo
To check out my code just go to the demo page [here](https://avigael.github.io/demo-animejs/ "here").
